1. At The Waterfall?
--------------------

Yes, at the waterfall. We'll seek out a site which has a nice waterfall and
then we'll build a basic, easily defendable entrance. From there you're on
your own.


2. The World
------------

The large, the better. If you don't find a site suitable, you'll have
to generate another world.


3. The Embark
-------------

No limitations or suggestions, we'll only need a miner, mason and architect.


4. Let's Find A Waterfall.
--------------------------

We're looking for a place where two or more rivers meet, like this one:

If you've found a promising site, check the cliffs:

That looks very promising, we need a site with "Very High Cliffs" or
even "Extreme Cliffs". So let's check this site out. Embark!


5. Admire

Welcome to your new home.


6. Suggestion For An Entrance
-----------------------------

Now that we have such a nice place, one way is to build a staircase down on
one side, bridge the ravine with a bridge and dig into the other side.
The pros for such an approach is that the entrance is easily defendable.

First gather raw material to build down stairs. Carving stairs into the side
of the ravine might turn out to be a bad idea if there is an aquifer involved.
After you have enough material you can start to designate down stairs at one
side.

You'll have to designate every layer on it's own, I fear. Also make sure that
this staircase reaches under any aquifer that may exist on that mountain.

If you're happy with the level, build some upstairs and a bridge over to the other side.

Now you can start to dig into the mountain. The bridge is retractable, so if
something wants to get into your fortress will have to able to fly. Additionally
it can be sealed with a raising bridge.

Now, get to it!

7. Helpful Thoughts
-------------------

### Dwarven Washing Machine

You can also build the bridge through the mist generated by the waterfall or
even that close that your dwarves will be washed by the waterfall. But mind
that they can be washed off the bridge.


### Fortifications

You can fortify the staircase of course. As the caravans can not go through
stairs, you most likely want to build the trade depot on the starting side and
some walls around it.

If you have a raising bridge that closes of your entrance, you can carve
fortifications into the layer above your entrance, effectively allowing you
to shoot at anyone on the bridge.
